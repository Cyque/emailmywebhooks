#Email My Webhooks

A Shopify store owner can add the application as an add-on for their store.
The application allows a store owner to receive email notifications for a chosen set of store webhooks. For example, an email can be sent to the store owner when a customer creates an account on their store.

The application backend is developed on Node.js running express. OAuth protocol is used to securely communicate with Shopify servers. The front end is running Javascript rendered with Jade-rendered HTML.

Currently in alpha phase.
